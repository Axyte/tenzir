# s3

Loads bytes from an Amazon S3 object. Saves bytes to an Amazon S3 object.

## Synopsis

Loader:

```
s3 [--anonymous] <uri>
```

Saver:

```
s3 [--anonymous] <uri>
```

## Description

The `s3` loader connects to an S3 bucket to acquire raw bytes from an S3
object. The `s3` saver writes bytes to an S3 object in an S3 bucket.

The connector tries to retrieve the appropriate credentials using AWS's
[default credentials provider
chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-java/latest/developer-guide/credentials-chain.html).

### `<uri>` (Loader, Saver)

The path to the S3 object.

The syntax is
`s3://<bucket-name>/<full-path-to-object>(?<options>)`.

Options can be appended to the path as query parameters, as per
[Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/fs.html#connecting-directly-with-a-uri):

> For S3, the options that can be included in the URI as query parameters are
`region`, `scheme`, `endpoint_override`, `access_key`, `secret_key`,
`allow_bucket_creation`, and `allow_bucket_deletion`.

### `--anonymous` (Loader, Saver)

Ignore any predefined credentials and try to load/save with anonymous
credentials.

## Examples

Read CSV from an object `obj.csv` in the bucket `examplebucket`:

```
from s3 s3://examplebucket/obj.csv read csv
```

Read JSON from an object `test.json` in the bucket `examplebucket`, but using a
different, S3-compatible endpoint:

```
from s3 s3://examplebucket/test.json?endpoint_override=s3.us-west.mycloudservice.com
```
