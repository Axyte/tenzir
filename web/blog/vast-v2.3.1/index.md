[VAST v2.3.1][github-vast-release] is now available. This small bugfix release
addresses an issue where [compaction][compaction] would hang if encountering
invalid partitions that were produced by older versions of VAST when a large
`max-partition-size` was set in combination with badly compressible input data.
