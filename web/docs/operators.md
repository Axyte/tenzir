# Operators

An *operator* is the execution building block of a [pipeline](pipelines.md).

There exist three primary types:

1. **Source**: produces data
2. **Sink**: consumes data
3. **Transformation**: produces and consumes data

Additionally, [user-defined operators](language/user-defined-operators.md) add
an alias for a pipeline to use it as operator.
