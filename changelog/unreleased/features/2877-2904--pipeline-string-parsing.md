The `export` command now supports an optional pipeline string that allows for
chaining pipeline operators together and executing such a pipeline on the
exported data. This feature is experimental and the syntax is subject to change
without notice. New operators are only available in the new pipeline syntax, and
the old YAML syntax is deprecated.
