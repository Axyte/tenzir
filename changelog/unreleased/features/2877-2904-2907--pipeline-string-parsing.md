The `export`, `import` and `spawn source` commands now support an optional
pipeline string that allows for chaining pipeline operators together and
executing such a pipeline on incoming and outgoing data. This feature is
experimental and the syntax is subject to change without notice. New operators
are only available in the new pipeline syntax, and the old YAML syntax is
deprecated.
