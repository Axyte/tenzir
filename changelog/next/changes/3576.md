By default, the `json` printer does not print fields with `null` values anymore.
To get the old behavior, use `--emit-null-fields`.

The option `--omit-nulls` was renamed to `--omit-null-items`. It now only strips
`null` values from lists. Because null fields are now omitted by default, there
is no change in behavior, unless `--emit-null-fields` is also specified.
