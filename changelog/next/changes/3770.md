The `fluent-bit` source operator changed how it receives data from Fluent Bit.
The operator no longer requests JSON conversion from Fluent Bit prior to
processing an event, but instead directly processes the MsgPack data that Fluent
Bit uses internally. Using MsgPack increases robustness of event delivery, as we
found corner cases where Fluent Bit crops JSON message objects. The change also
increases throughput due to the absence of an extra fromat conversion.
