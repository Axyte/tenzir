# MISP integration

> **Warning** The MISP integration is considered experimental and subject to
> change without notice.

This directory contains the scripts to run MISP as part of the Tenzir Docker
compose stack.

## Standalone

To run the MISP without any integration with Tenzir:
```
cd docker/compose/
docker compose -f misp.yaml up
```

## Dynamic hostname

The `proxy` directory contains the setup for an NGINX that automatically
translates the MISP hostname to the one provided in the `Host` HTTP header of
the incomming requests. This is useful when running MISP behind some sort of
reverse proxy. You can use this proxy by applying the `misp.proxy.yaml` overlay.
